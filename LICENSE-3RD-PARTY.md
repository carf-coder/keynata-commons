# Third-party components shipped with this site

Keynata Commons serves everything it needs from its own domain — no third-party
CDN is contacted while the site is running. Three components are redistributed
here under the terms below. None of them restrict your use of the tracks
themselves, which remain CC0 1.0.

| Component | Files served from this site | Version | License |
|---|---|---|---|
| SpessaSynth (`spessasynth_lib` + `spessasynth_core`) | `vendor/spessasynth.min.js`, `vendor/spessasynth_processor.min.js` | 4.3.12 / 4.3.16 | Apache License 2.0 |
| GeneralUser GS instrument bank | `assets/GeneralUser-GS.sf2` | 2.0.3 | GeneralUser GS License v2.0 |
| 040 Florestan String Quartet instrument bank | `assets/040_Florestan_String_Quartet.sf2` | Aug 23, 2000 | Public Domain |

The two instrument banks are the same ones used to render the WAV and MP3 files
offered for download, so in-browser playback and the rendered audio draw on the
same instruments.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## 2. GeneralUser GS — GeneralUser GS License v2.0

Copyright 1997-2025 by S. Christian Collins.
Source: <https://www.schristiancollins.com> and
<https://github.com/mrbumpy409/GeneralUser-GS>.

The file `assets/GeneralUser-GS.sf2` is an unmodified copy of GeneralUser GS
2.0.3. In line with the "More info" clause below, this site serves its own local
copy rather than linking to the author's download files.

Full license text, as published with the bank:

```
*** GeneralUser GS v2.0.3 ***
***      License v2.0     ***

** License of the complete work **
You may use GeneralUser GS without restriction for your own music creation,
private or commercial. This SoundFont bank is provided to the community free of
charge. Please feel free to use it in your software projects, and to modify the
SoundFont bank or its packaging to suit your needs.

** License of contained samples **
GeneralUser GS inherits the usage rights of the samples contained within, all of
which allow full use in music production, including the ability to make profit
from musical recordings created with GeneralUser GS.

Many of the samples are original, but some were taken from other banks freely
(and legally) available on the Internet from various SoundFont websites. Because
GeneralUser GS originated as a personal project with no intention for
publication, I cannot be 100% sure where all of the samples originated, although
I do know that none of them came from commercially published SoundFont packages
or sample CDs. Regardless, many "free" SoundFonts available on the web may
indeed contain samples of questionable origin. My understanding of the
copyrights of all samples is only as good as the information provided by the
original sources. If you become aware of any restricted samples being used in
GeneralUser GS, please let me know so I can replace them.

This uncertainty may concern you if you intend to use GeneralUser GS in a
commercial software product. That being said, I have never received any
complaint regarding sample ownership since I published the original GeneralUser
GS back in 2000, and as far as I am aware, neither have any of the companies
creating commercial software products using GeneralUser GS.

** More info **
If you plan to feature GeneralUser GS on your own website, please do not link
directly to my download files. Either link to my website, or provide your own
local copy instead.

I hope you enjoy GeneralUser GS! This SoundFont bank is the product of many
years of hard work.

You can find updates to GeneralUser GS and more of my virtual instruments at:
http://www.schristiancollins.com

I can be reached via the contact page on my website here:

Thank you!

## 3. 040 Florestan String Quartet — Public Domain

Created by Nando Florestan, August 23, 2000. The bank's embedded RIFF INFO
metadata states `ICOP: Public Domain`, and the author's site distributes it as
such. It is redistributed here unmodified as
`assets/040_Florestan_String_Quartet.sf2`, and supplies the violin, viola and
cello voices (General MIDI programs 40-43).

## What this does not cover

The music itself — every WAV, MP3, MIDI and metadata file under `tracks/` — is
dedicated to the public domain under CC0 1.0 and is not affected by anything on
this page. See the License and Attribution sections of the home page.
